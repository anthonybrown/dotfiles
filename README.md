The install script broke my environment

These are my original files which were working to my liking

I decided to upload my dotfiles to github for safe keeping but when the script created the symlinks
it broke the way I had my plugins and stuff installed.

Using the YADR dotfiles, I like it except for one thing.... It's not using oh-my-zsh
